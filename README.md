## Internet Exploder
A game about fighting off the vengeful return of Internet Explorer! 
## What it does
**Internet Exploder** is a game that's based around the idea of the vengeful return of Internet Explorer. 
Many people remember how slow and buggy it was at times, and we wanted to capture that in this game. 
You have to dodge bugs, viruses, malware, and more as you try to take down the browser before it gets too powerful. 
A simple concept, but a lot of fun!
## Game Tips
Move with either W/A/S/D or Arrow Keys.
When in combat, you need to collect powerups and avoid hazards that Internet Exploder will throw at you.
  - _Firewalls_ are the orange circles, they provide a one-time shield to avoid damage.
  - _Refreshes_ are your offense against IE. It definitely can't handle many of those...
  - _Viruses_ are red and need to be avoided, unless you want to get infected!
  - _Malware_ is purple and has a skull. Spooky.
  - _Bugs_ are bright green, try to avoid stepping on them!
  - _Corrupt Data_ is rampant, avoid these to keep your info in line.
Watch out for extra tactics IE might pull on you, it's desperate to return and take over the world!
## Inspiration
As a team mostly made of people who could have this hackathon be our very last one due to graduating soon,
we wanted to do something fun and quirky to make some memories. Amusing jokes and funny concepts eventually 
lead to **Internet Exploder**.
## How we built it
The team utilized the Unity Game Engine to create our game, taking advantage of its easily accessible game assets 
and convenient features to create more things faster. Work was split among ourselves to maximize productivity.
## Challenges we ran into
One major challenge was figuring out the relatively steep learning curve that is collisions in Unity. There are 
many different methods for handling them, and not all of them worked for what we wanted. With enough effort and 
research however, we were able to overcome it. Another major challenge was getting GitHub to work with Unity. 
We started learning pretty quickly that the built in GitHub for Unity tool was not very precise and tended to 
_mostly_ do what we wanted, and that combined with a couple slip-ups in version control really set us back once or twice.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The general aesthetic of the game, while simplistic, is something we're all pretty proud of. It took a while to 
decide on certain aspects of the design like background music, hazard assets, and how to handle certain scenarios. 
The fact that we essentially completed everything we set out to do this time around is definitely something we're proud of. 
In the past, we had not really been able to do that.
## What we learned
> How to utilize certain functions of Unity
> How to connect Unity to GitHub
> New techniques for using GitHub
> How to stitch together a simple concept and story for a game
## What's next for Internet Exploder
In the early stages of development while we were still fleshing out the major points of the design, we had an idea to 
increase the game's length by establishing a story of moving through the ages of technology and leaving IE behind, only for 
it to come back with a vengeance. The player would navigate mazes of cluttered desktops from older windows versions, eventually 
finding ways to more and more current versions, up until Windows 10, where the current version of **Internet Exploder** begins. 
Perhaps the infamous browser isn't quite finished after the game's events, either...
